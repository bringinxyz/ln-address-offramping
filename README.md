# Bringin LN Address Offramping Integration Guide

## Overview

Bringin allows **payment providers, merchant platforms, and Lightning service providers** to offer seamless *Bitcoin-to-Euro offramping* using Lightning Addresses.

A Lightning Address looks like an email address ‚Äî e.g.: `merchant@bringin.xyz`

When sats are sent to this address, they are converted into Euros and credited to the merchant's **vIBAN account** inside Bringin. The funds are:

‚úÖ Instantly spendable via **physical/virtual debit card**  
‚úÖ Withdrawable via **instant SEPA bank transfer**

## Key Benefits for Payment Providers

* Provide **Bitcoin ‚Üí Euro offramping** directly from Lightning payments
* No banking integration or card program needed on your side
* Works with your existing Lightning stack (custodial or non-custodial)
* Bringin handles conversion, compliance, settlement
* Merchants can spend Euros via card or withdraw to bank

## What is a Lightning Address?

A Lightning Address is a **human-readable identifier** that looks like an email, but works as a payment address on the Lightning Network.

Example: `merchant@bringin.xyz`

Internally, it is built on **LNURL-Pay**, allowing wallets or services to retrieve payment parameters and send Lightning payments.

## How It Works

1Ô∏è‚É£ The payment provider resolves the LN address (LNURL-Pay spec)  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Sends a Lightning payment to the generated invoice  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Bringin converts received BTC to EUR  
4Ô∏è‚É£ EUR is credited to merchant's vIBAN  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Merchant can spend using debit card or withdraw via SEPA Instant

## Default Limits

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Default **minSendable** is ‚Ç¨10 worth of sats (because of exchange partner limits)

This works well when users send funds manually from their wallet by typing in the LN address.

## POS / Micro-transaction Use Case

For **small payments** (e.g. 100 sats), we support a special mode:

Add `?pos=true` to the LNURL request:

```bash
https://bringin.xyz/.well-known/lnurlp/merchant?pos=true
```

* **minSendable**: 100 sats (10000 millisats)

## LNURL-Pay Example Response

```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "tag": "payRequest",
  "callback": "https://bringin.xyz/lnurlp/merchant/callback",
  "metadata": "[[\"text/plain\",\"Payment to merchant@bringin.xyz\"]]",
  "commentAllowed": 120,
  "minSendable": "100000", // 100 sats
  "maxSendable": 5471036000,
  "payerData": {
    "name": {
      "mandatory": false
    },
    "email": {
      "mandatory": false
    },
    "pubkey": {
      "mandatory": false
    }
  }
}
```

## How to Integrate Using JS Library

You can easily enable LN address payments in your app using: üì¶ lnurl-pay

### Install

```bash
npm install lnurl-pay
```

### Basic Example

```js
const lnurlPay = require('lnurl-pay');

(async () => {
  const lnAddress = 'merchant@bringin.xyz';
  const lnurlData = await lnurlPay.requestInvoice({
    lnUrlOrAddress: lnAddress
  });
  
  console.log('Invoice:', lnurlData.invoice);
  console.log('Callback URL:', lnurlData.callback);
  console.log('Min sendable:', lnurlData.minSendable);
})();
```

### Example with POS Mode (low minSendable)

```js
const lnurlPay = require('lnurl-pay');

(async () => {
  const lnAddress = 'merchant@bringin.xyz';
  const lnurlWithPOS = 'https://bringin.xyz/.well-known/lnurlp/merchant?pos=true';
  
  const lnurlData = await lnurlPay.requestInvoice({
    lnUrlOrAddress: lnurlWithPOS
  });
  
  console.log('Invoice for POS:', lnurlData.invoice);
})();
```

Testing
You can test Bringin LN Address offramping on our sandbox environment:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Go to:
https://bringin-lite-test.vercel.app/

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a test user account (use fake KYC details ‚Äî no real data required)

3Ô∏è‚É£ After creating account, go to:
https://dev-app.bringin.xyz/

4Ô∏è‚É£ From the Bringin Dashboard, claim a test LN Address ‚Äî looks like:
prashanth@dev.bringin.xyz

5Ô∏è‚É£ You can now send test Bitcoin over Lightning to this LN Address.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Funds will appear in your test vIBAN balance as EUR (test mode).
